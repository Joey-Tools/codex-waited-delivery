# Codex Waited Delivery Compatibility

Historical and experimental child-and-wait delivery workflow tooling retained
for explicit compatibility work and run recovery.

This repository no longer represents an active personal skill. Do not add
`waited-delivery-compat` to a personal-skill link manifest and do not register
its hooks by default. The historical hook commands are inert unless the caller
passes `--enable-compat-hook`, and their diagnostics never record prompt or
assistant-message previews.

See [docs/DEPENDENCIES.md](docs/DEPENDENCIES.md) for the optional review
compatibility/diagnostic dependency used by external lane-readiness smoke.

## Test

```bash
python3 -m py_compile skills/waited-delivery-compat/scripts/*.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s skills/waited-delivery-compat/tests
```
